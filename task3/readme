#Hello Dmitry!
#
#My idea is to setup http or/and ftp services depending on an inventory file
#Example of  inventory
#[nodes]
#node1.example.com serv=httpd
#node2.example.com serv=vsftpd
#This means that  httpd should be installed on node1 as well as vsftpd on node2. And nothing to do if that services already exist.
#
#I have applied the role SERV (3 tasks file, var file, handler file, template), ansible_facts variables, included tasks etc.
#The playbook task-to-clear.ymp to reset hosts to initial  state
#Regards Tatiana
